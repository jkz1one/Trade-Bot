# Slice 2 — Robinhood READ / SHADOW Status

## Current checkpoint — 2026-10-03

Branch: `slice2/robinhood-read-shadow`. PR #1 remains draft. `main` remains untouched.
The authenticated core path is verified: strict OpenAI output, real Robinhood reads,
model judgment, deterministic governor and persisted SHADOW audit. Scheduling is
implemented and verified offline; a scheduled authenticated market-session cycle
remains to be observed. LIVE is disabled.

## Authenticated evidence from the user's Mac

The latest batch pulled `7abcf284ee84a787020ba5913c5cc8d504ee930c` and passed
**105 tests** in 3.66 seconds. Every subsequent command completed:

- `openai-structured-check`: OK, `gpt-6-luna`, HOLD, structured output accepted;
  Robinhood untouched.
- `shadow-cycle --agent openai`: reconciled account, no position or working orders,
  20 candidates and mixed regime. Model returned HOLD; governor rejected entry with
  `NO_ENTRY_REQUEST`; execution SKIPPED. No broker review or order submission.
- `shadow-audit`: cycle 6, packet timestamp `2026-10-03T17:52:06.028989`, prompt
  `v2-live-shadow`, model `gpt-6-luna`, latency 12,730 ms and explicitly linked evidence.
  Usage: 2,999 input / 322 output tokens; estimated cost **$0.00046090**.
  SPY observations: 769.86 to 769.86.
- `shadow-history --limit 100`: six HOLDs, including four historical agent failures,
  one earlier stub HOLD and this real model HOLD. Five legacy cycles were unlinked;
  only cycle 6 had explicitly linked evidence and usage. Zero broker reviews.

The model cited stale quotes and the Saturday session as reasons to stay in cash.
This verifies plumbing and a valid HOLD, not useful trading signal or profitability.
The governor-approved `review_equity_order` path has full simulated-cycle tests;
an authenticated approved review has not yet been observed.

Earlier batches passed 58, 95 and 105 tests but stopped respectively at an unsupported
Decimal schema regex and exhausted API credits. Those failures did not reach the
subsequent Robinhood cycle. The successful batch above supersedes the credit blocker.
Price wire schemas now accept number/string without the unsupported regex; Decimal
precision, positivity, finiteness and application limits still validate after parsing.

## Market-session runner

- `shadow-run --agent openai` polls locally every 30 seconds and starts at most one
  cycle per 15-minute slot, anchored to the XNYS regular-session open.
- The exchange calendar handles weekends, holidays, daylight saving and early closes.
  Closed sessions skip before initializing broker or model clients. Calendar errors
  and dates outside calendar coverage fail closed, with exit 12.
- Restart runs only the current slot; it never catches up missed slots.
- An additive SQLite table claims each slot before external calls. A unique active
  lock allows only one scheduled cycle in flight across workers sharing the database.
- Cycle evidence and slot completion commit together. Previously attempted slots
  never automatically retry, including model or review failures.
- A crash or interruption while a claim is active leaves it CLAIMED and blocks future
  scheduled cycles (exit 10). Inspect `shadow-schedule-status` and the audit before
  resolving an interrupted claim. No expiration or automatic replay is implemented.
- Session boundaries and scheduled time enter the packet. The session is checked
  again after reads and before review. If it has closed, model judgment or review is
  skipped as appropriate and the reason persists in execution evidence.
- Existing daily entry limits now count completed hypothetical entry reviews from
  persisted history, using the New York calendar day. Unreviewed proposals do not
  count. The existing exit cooldown uses the latest completed hypothetical close
  review and survives restarts. These are review controls, not simulated fills.
- Prompt version is now `v3-session-shadow`. The last authenticated model run used
  `v2-live-shadow`; the updated prompt has not yet been exercised against OpenAI.

The process runs in the foreground and must remain running on an awake machine.
It is not automatically installed as a service. Separate database files do not share
claims; use the same `robinhood.db` for this one-trader experiment.

## Persistent audit and history

New cycles save decision, exact usage, account/benchmark snapshots and reconciliation
in one transaction. Explicit evidence links prevent borrowing usage from an earlier
cycle. Legacy rows remain `LEGACY_UNLINKED`; missing usage is unknown.

`shadow-history` separates explicitly linked model HOLDs, deterministic stub/session
HOLDs, unattributed HOLDs and agent failures. For compatibility, `genuine_hold_count`
still means all non-failure HOLDs; it is not a model-only count. Session context and
blocked execution counts are included. SPY output is a raw quote-price return with
sample endpoints. Strategy/economic P&L remains null: there is no counterfactual fill
ledger yet, and SHADOW submits no trades.

Audit, history and schedule status make no OpenAI or Robinhood calls:

```bash
python -m app.robinhood.cli shadow-audit
python -m app.robinhood.cli shadow-history --limit 100
python -m app.robinhood.cli shadow-schedule-status
```

## Authority and configuration

- Default remains PAPER, with a separate `trader.db`. Robinhood defaults to `robinhood.db`.
- Trader Agent has `tools=[]`, strict `TradeDecision` and `max_turns=1`.
- Deterministic software approves/rejects/sizes, capped by unleveraged buying power.
- SHADOW may use only `review_equity_order` after governor approval for hypothetical
  trading. It never submits or cancels an order. LIVE remains disabled.
- Broker/local mismatches fail closed, including unsupported assets, multiple positions,
  unowned/missing positions, quantity/symbol mismatch, non-long positions and working orders.
- Robinhood discovery proved 76 tools and schemas without required-tool/schema gaps.
  Accounts, portfolio, positions, working orders, quotes, historical OHLCV, indicators,
  tradability and regime construction work. Historical requests deliberately fetch
  one symbol per call to avoid the MCP SDK's 1 MiB SSE-event ceiling.
- Universe: SPY, QQQ, IWM, DIA, XLK, XLF, XLE, XLI, XLV, XLY, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA,
  AMZN, META, GOOGL, TSLA, AVGO, JPM, COST.
- Model: `gpt-6-luna`; configured standard prices: $0.10 / 1M input tokens and
  $0.50 / 1M output tokens. Costs are estimates using these configured rates.
- Agent errors persist fail-closed HOLD and exit 8; review errors persist decision,
  risk and usage with sanitized error class and exit 9. No failure submits an order.

## Verification and next use

Install the new calendar dependency after pulling:

```bash
git pull --ff-only && \
pip install -e '.[dev]' && \
pytest -q && \
python -m app.robinhood.cli shadow-run --agent openai --once && \
python -m app.robinhood.cli shadow-schedule-status
```

Outside a regular session the tick reports MARKET_CLOSED without using API credits
or Robinhood. During a session it attempts the current slot and persists its result.
Inspect audit/history after a completed cycle. The already successful structured-output
check need not be repeated. To collect regular-session history, start:

```bash
python -m app.robinhood.cli shadow-run --agent openai
```

Updated local suite: **136 passed**. Compilation, fatal-error lint and whitespace
checks passed. The real CLI's Saturday tick returned MARKET_CLOSED with exit 0;
schedule status reported no active claim or slots and no network calls.

Local verification covers calendar boundaries, concurrent SQLite claims, restarts,
crash blocking, rollback, sanitized failures, persistent New York daily limits,
cooldown expiry, session-ending reads/model calls and review-only execution.
No authenticated OpenAI or Robinhood calls were made in this execution workspace;
it has neither API credentials nor Robinhood OAuth state.

Next experiment work: counterfactual fills/position ledger, SPY and net-of-model-cost
economic comparison, and enough market-session model decisions to evaluate signal.
No profitability claim or LIVE enablement follows from this checkpoint.
